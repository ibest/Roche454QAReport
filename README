This file describes the contents and functions of the script files located in this directory.

required_for_heatmap:
	This script has two system calls:
		the first goes though and grabs the name seq name tag ">", and writes it to tmp.txt
		the second calls a perlscript (parse.location.info.pl) to parse the tmp.tex pulling: sequence name, location, length, and score 
		ggplot2 is then called to plot the data stored as variable "d"
		the "m" variable is under development.  it will heat the plot by quality

requied_for_plots:
	This script has the meat of the Roche 454 package in it
		the first couple lines read in the sequences and quality
		the subsequent lines (this list is unordered)
			get max read length	
			get quality over read length
			quality over bp
			ect
		this script is where the package spends most of its compute time

quality_over_base_length_box = quality_over_length_box (sorry about that)
	this script takes in avg.qual.tab from required_for_plots
		the object contains the average quality of each read based on their length
		the if else statements adds a factor vector that is used by ggplot as a break for each box (I AM SURE THERE IS A BETTER WAY)
	the output is a boxplot that is broken on length of read.

read_hist_base_length:
	this script takes the object read.length.dataframe from required_for_plot
	this outputs a histogram of read lengths 

quality_box_plot:
	takes in avg.qual.tab from required_for_plots
	bins the avg read quality and then creates a boxplot

read_length_hist_qual:
	create a histogram of read lengths broken up into groups by quality

read_hist:
	create a plain old histogram of read lengths
